### Smart Animate Click Effect - Figma Prototype
## Project Overview

This project is an interactive design prototype created in Figma that demonstrates a Smart Animate effect with Ease Out timing triggered on click.

The prototype not only animates elements smoothly between frames but also includes color-changing interactions when navigating to other pages. This enhances visual feedback and simulates realistic user interactions, making the design feel more responsive and engaging.

## Features

- Smart Animate: Elements transition smoothly between frames, creating fluid motion.
- Ease Out Effect: Animations decelerate naturally toward the end for polished motion.
- On Click Trigger: Interactions occur only when the user clicks elements.
- Color Change Interaction: Elements change color to indicate navigation or selection, improving visual feedback.
- Interactive Prototype: Users can engage with the design to experience transitions, color changes, and multi-page navigation in real time.
