Smart Animate Click Effect - Figma Prototype
Project Overview

This project is an interactive design prototype created in Figma that demonstrates a Smart Animate effect with Ease Out timing triggered on click.

The prototype not only animates elements smoothly between frames but also includes color-changing interactions when navigating to other pages. This enhances visual feedback and simulates realistic user interactions, making the design feel more responsive and engaging.
